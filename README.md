# Harry-Potter-Playlist-Manager
Harry Potter Movie Playlist Manager is a C++ console-based application designed to manage and navigate a playlist of Harry Potter movies using a Doubly Linked List. Each movie is stored as a node containing details such as the movie title and release year.

The system allows users to:

Add new movies

Delete movies by title

Display the full playlist

Navigate forward and backward between movies

View the currently playing movie

This project demonstrates dynamic memory management, traversal, and pointer manipulation—core concepts of data structures. It serves as a practical and interactive example of implementing a doubly linked list for real-world playlist management.

# Harry Potter Movie Playlist Manager  
A C++ project that uses a **Doubly Linked List** to manage a playlist of Harry Potter movies.  
Users can add, delete, view, and navigate through movies just like a media player.
